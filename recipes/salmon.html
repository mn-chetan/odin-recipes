    <p>
      This pistachio-crusted salmon recipe makes ordinary salmon extra special
      by topping it with a flavorful crust. You can have it on the table in
      under 30 minutes for a quick weeknight meal or a dinner party for guests.
      Serve it with a chilled glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Â¼ cup crushed pistachios</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
      <li>4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon with skin, center cut</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>4 lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Combine pistachios, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and butter in a small
        bowl; stir with a fork until evenly combined.
      </li>
      <li>Lightly season salmon fillets with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Sear
        salmon fillets, flesh-side down, for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn heat off and
        flip salmon pieces over so skin side is down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush tops of salmon evenly with Dijon mustard. Top with pistachio
        mixture, pressing mixture down onto salmon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 10 to
        12 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.
