      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup potato starch</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 cup wheat dextrin (such as EverCrispÂ® Breader and Batter Boost)</li>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Sauce</strong>

    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, or as needed for garnish (optional)
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped peanuts, or as needed for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. In a large bowl toss
        chicken wings, chicken legs, ginger, garlic, salt, pepper, and water
        together. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another bowl combine flour, potato starch, cornstarch, and EverCrisp
        in a large mixing bowl. Whisk ingredients until fully mixed. Season with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup of flour mixture to the bowl with chicken. Mix into chicken
        and water to make a very thin batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken to the flour bowl and toss and press until completely
        dredged in mixture. Place on the prepared wire rack until ready to fry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (165 degrees
        C). Line a second rimmed baking sheet with paper towels, and place a
        clean wire rack on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken pieces to the hot oil about 5 pieces at a time so as not to
        drop the temperature of the oil. Fry for 6 minutes. Transfer chicken to
        the rack over the paper towel-lined baking sheet tray. Continue with
        remaining chicken pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until
        continuously boiling. Carefully add the first batch of cooked chicken
        and fry again until cooked through and crispy, about 5 minutes more.
        Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the
        second batch of chicken pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a medium-sized serving bowl. Heat a small saucepan
        over medium-low heat. Add sesame oil, grated garlic, grated ginger,
        brown sugar, gochujang paste, vinegar, and 1/2 cup water. Cook and stir
        continuously until sugar has melted and sauce is smooth, about 5
        minutes. Drizzle sauce over twice-fried chicken pieces, garnish with
        sesame seed and peanuts, and serve.
