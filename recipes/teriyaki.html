      <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1/3 cup brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons canola or peanut oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon finely minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced, divided</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups cooked rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine soy sauce, sake, rice vinegar, and brown sugar in a bowl and
        whisk well until sugar is dissolved. Stir in sesame seeds and crushed
        red pepper and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oils in a large skillet over high heat. Sprinkle salt and pepper
        evenly over chicken. Add chicken in a single layer to the skillet and
        cook, undisturbed until chicken is browned and releases easily from the
        pan, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken pieces, cook 1 more minute and remove
        from pan; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium and add ginger and garlic. Cook, stirring
        constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the
        green onions for garnish and add remaining green onions to the skillet.
        Cook for 1 minute. Add 1 cup reserved soy sauce mixture to the skillet
        and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up any browned bits from the
        bottom of the skillet. Bring mixture to a boil and cook until sauce has
        reduced by about a third or until slightly thickened and glossy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until
        sauce is thickened slightly and chicken is coated in the sauce and
        cooked through. Serve over rice and sprinkled with reserved green
        onions.
      </li>
    </ol>
